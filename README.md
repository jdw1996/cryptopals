# haskell-cryptopals
My Haskell solutions to the [Matasano Cryptopals
challenges](https://cryptopals.com/).

## Format

Each set of problems has its own subdirectory (or will, once I have started on
it). For a challenge Y in set X, the file ```SetXChallengeY.hs``` is a module
containing the functions that solve the problem (and sometimes other functions,
for the sake of completeness) and the file ``sXcYmain.hs``` is a compilable
program that displays the answer to the specific problem given.
