# haskell-cryptopals
My Haskell solutions to the [Matasano Cryptopals
challenges](https://cryptopals.com/).

## Format

Each set of problems has its own subdirectory (or will, once I have started on
it). For a challenge `Y` in set `X`, the file `SetXChallengeY.hs` is a module
containing the functions that solve the problem (and sometimes other functions,
for the sake of completeness) and the file `sXcYmain.hs` is a compilable
program that displays the answer to the specific problem given.

## Style

I'm using these challenges to learn more about cryptography, but also to learn
about Haskell, alongside Miran Lipovaƒça's [*Learn You a Haskell for Great
Good*](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), which I highly recommend as an
introductory course. Anyway, because I'm still learning Haskell, my style may
not always be the best. If you have experience in the language and pointers
you'd like to share, feel free to open an issue or email me at
